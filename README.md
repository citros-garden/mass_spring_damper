# General Information üåç

This is a simple ROS demonstration of a mass-spring-damper system.
In the ROS system we have two nodes: the first represents the dynamics and the second one is the controller.

## System dynamics

The system's equations of motion:

$$m\ddot x =  kf(t) -c\dot x -kx$$

and after laplace transformation (with zero I.C) we get a second order system:

$${X \over F} = {\omega_n^2 \over s^2 +2\omega_n\zeta s + \omega_n^2} $$

where the natural frequency $\omega_n = \sqrt{k \over m}$

You can choose the system's parameters `m`, `k` and `c` and choose the initial condition `x0`, `v0` and `a0` and set them in the [dynamics parameters file](src/dynamics/config/params.yaml)


## The controller

You can write your own controller to try stabilize the system for a given setpoint.

the default controller is a simple PID controller with the following form:

$$f(t) = {k_pe(t) + k_i\int{e(t)dt}} + k_d {d\over dt}(e(t))$$

you can tune the controller gains, $k_p$, $k_i$, $k_d$ on the [controller parameters file](src/controller/config/params.yaml)


# Installation üõ´

clone the repository to your local machine:
                
                git clone git@github.com:citros-garden/mass_spring_damper.git

open the repository in the VScode:

                cd ~/mass_spring_damper
                code .

open the repository in the container from VScode with `reopen in container` option.

# Build :tractor:

build and source the workspace:

                colcon build
                source install/local_setup.bash

# Run üöÄ

## Recommended

Use VSCode tasks. build with `build` and then launch simulator with `launch` (default controller).

## From Terminal (NOT RECOMMENDED)

you can run the free-system without controller with this launch file:

                ros2 launch dynamics dynamics.launch.py


to run the default controller:

                ros2 launch dynamics dynamics_controller.launch.py

# Develop :bulb:

Open the project in a `devcontainer` with `reopen in container` option in VSCode, all the development environment is ready for further development.
